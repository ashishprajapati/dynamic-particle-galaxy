# Dynamic Particle Galaxy

## Project Overview
"Dynamic Particle Galaxy" is a cool project that turns your screen into a vibrant, starry night sky, moving and shining in response to where you guide your mouse. It's like holding a piece of the universe in your hand, making your digital space come alive with the dance of colors and light.

## Features
- **Interactive Particles**: Particles respond dynamically to mouse movement.
- **Customizable Aesthetics**: Easily adjust particle size, speed, and color.

## How to Use
Simply move your mouse across the screen to see the particles react and create patterns that resemble the night sky.
